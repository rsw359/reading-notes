## Crud

Which HTTP method would you use to update a record through an API? *PUT*
Which REST methods require an ID parameter? *DELETE* and *PUT*

Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?

- Crud is the flow and Rest are the methods that are used to create the API

If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?

- Install dependencies
- Mount router
- Access Mongo/DB
- Creating a schema

Then create routes for:

- Get - making a query
- Post - adding things to the server
- Put - Updating the existing items
- Delete - Deleting things from the server
