# The Random Module in Python**

**Randint** - The randint function accepts two parameters: a lowest and a highest number and generates integers between them

**Random** - Use the random function to generate a number between zero and an input

Choice - Generate a random value from a sequence or list `random.choice( ['red', 'black', 'green'] )`

**Shuffle** - The shuffle function shuffles the elements in a list, placing them in a random order

**Randrange -** Generate a randomly selected element from range `for i in range(3):``print random.randrange(0, 101, 5)`

## ****Risk Analysis****

The probability of any unwanted incident is defined as Risk.

Risk analysis is the process of identifying the risks in applications or software.

Some risks that you could encounter are:

1. Use of new hardware
2. Use of new technology
3. Use of new automation tool
4. The sequence of code
5. Availability of test resources for the application

There are three perspectives of Risk Assessment:

- Effect
- Cause
- Likelihood

**Effect –** Assessing risk by its **effect** in an effort determine its impact.

**Cause –** Assessing risk by **Cause** is opposite of  assessing by Effect. Assessing by cause means  analyzing the problem to determine the most probable reason behind it.

**Likelihood –** To assess risk by Likelihood is to say that there is a probability that a requirement won’t be satisfied.

## Big O Video

1. Different Steps get added:  if there are 2 steps add them O(a) + O(b) = O(a+b)
2. Drop Constants: 2 O(N) is not O(2N), it’s just O(N)
3. For different inputs, use different Variables
4. Drop non-dominant terms.
