  - In order to center an image, it could be made into a block lvl element using display:block, then use text-align:center
  - Background images have some interesting properties that can be used, such as, repeat(both horizontally and vertically), repeat-x(horizontally), repeat-y(vertically), or fixed and scroll
  - Image rollover settings can also be set in css, allowing for interaction from the user
  - It is a good practice to use low contrast images when they will be covered by text. a screen can also be used
