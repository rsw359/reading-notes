# *Css Layout*

## Display

- Elements in CSS can be displayed in block, inline, or flex
  - Block items start on a new line
  - Inline items sit next to each other
  - Flex sets up a parent element as a block item and converts its children to flex items

## Flexbox and Grid

### Flexbox

- Flexbox allows child items to be controlled along horizontal or vertical axis
- Using justify content, align items, and wrap properties allow for the modification of flex (child) items
- Using flexbox allows for the manipulation of the sizing of flex items as well

### Grid

- Grid allows child items to controlled along both horizontal AND vertical axis
- Grid allows child items to controlled with repeatable rule sets
- Grid allows individual child items to controlled whereas flexbox controls them as a group

### Others

- Multicolumn layout automatically splits long lists
- The positioning property allows for the adjustment of the behavior of an element eithin the flow of a page using relative, absolute, fixed, sticky or static values
