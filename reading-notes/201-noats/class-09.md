- Events are caused by user interactions, which trigger events that cause scripts to run
  - The occurance of an event is referred to as it having been 'raised' or 'fired', this in turn triggers an script
  - The correct syntax for creating an event listener is `element.eventListenerName('event, functionName, [, boolean];)`
  - Event listeners can be bound to parent elements of the affected element
  - This binding indicates what event is be listened for, and which element will be affected
